                      <h3>Literature Survey</h3>
                      <p> 
                        In recent years, there’s a significant tendency of increasing road accidents throughout the world especially in developing countries starting nearly 1.35 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of deaths due to road accidents in Sri Lanka reached 3,554 as per the latest WHO data published in 2017.  Insufficient exposure and consciousness among populations about traffic environments and rules cause the growth of road accident statistics. Exceeding speed limits, driving under the impact of alcohol and other psychoactive substances, non-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts, and child restraints, and distracted driving are the primary risk factors for road traffic injuries. However, the impacts of road accidents lead to both social and economic deprivations. As the protectors of the public, the police seek proper solutions to mitigate the impacts of road accidents. Accordingly, many experts have introduced various solutions to alleviate the consequences of road accidents.

                    <h5 style="color:white;">Predict Road Accidents</h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition, some research has analyzed traffic accidents more deeply to determine the intensity of accidents by implementing four advanced SL algorithms of Machine Learning (ML). Those approaches are Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). The outcomes of this related work are the severity of accidents mentioned as fatal, grievous, and simple injury and monitoring the collision. However, some systems are technology biased in order to be embedded in vehicles. In addition, there are analysis and predictions of the black spots, accident-prone zones, and road conditions using exploratory visualization techniques and regression analysis. In addition, the authors have considered the type of accident and the type of spot using the R tool for their estimations. Also, they have pointed out the data of road accidents with their frequencies and analyzed correlation analysis and exploratory visualization approaches. However, some road accident predictions are supported by the sensor technology also. In there, a thorough analysis of the collision data is used to identify the leading causes of accidents, the accident-prone locations as well as to predict the conditions for collision occurrence.

                    <h5 style="color:white;">Scheduling Traffic Police Officers </h4>
                    <p>
                        However different countries have come up with distinct solutions utilizing diverse technologies worldwide. A proper traffic police officer scheduling system is a great solution as many countries worldwide are trying different approaches to schedule and enforce traffic police officers at the appropriate times and locations. Nevertheless, even different countries follow different approaches to solve this matter, the problem of determining a proper working schedule in accordance with the needs and preferences of police stations still remains. Due to the exponential growth of economic construction and transportation, the need for a proper police officers scheduling system has become a leading requirement. Problems such as, “How to strengthen the management of traffic police? How to complete traffic management work efficiently? How to make full use of efficient resources?”  are major matters that needed to be resolved by the Government of many countries.  Most of the existing scheduling systems are usually following a manual approach by commanders of police stations which is inconvenient and time consuming.

                    <h5 style="color:white;">A Game-Based Approach to Improve Road Accident Prevention Awareness Among Public</h4>
                    <p>
                        There were many types of research conducted in the field of first aid and game-based learning.  The research conducted in Dubaicpresented the appropriateness of a virtual environment for training traffic investigators of the Dubai police force.  The Torque game engine has been used to build the game.  In order to assess the result, the police officers were categorized into two groups as Novices and Experienced.  The restriction placed in this study was that each and every participant in the experiment must have computer knowledge.  To implement the game, 3D Studio Max was used to create a game world, interfaces of the game were created using interface builder which was provided by Torque, OntRAT was used to create the game model and game behavior through API or Python scripting language.  The research result shows that game-based learning gave significant results than lectures and on-job- training methods and the performance of novices was higher than the performance of the experienced group.

                    <h5 style="color:white;">A Game-Based Approach to Improve Post Road Accident Responsibility Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>
                        A 3D serious game for the first aid emergency named FASim aims to learn the first aids.  The FASim game focused on the interaction between players, the adaption of the game to the profiles of the players, the importance of awareness and prevention, and finally makes quick and accurate decisions.  And the solutions of FASim are based on agent-based simulation. The game-based mobile platform to instruct first aid techniques study makes first aid learning procedure with realistic models and scenarios. This mobile application developed using a motion capture system, three-dimensional modeling, and game engine technologies, contains Simulation Courses, Applied Games, and Examinations as its main modules.  In Simulation Courses, a realistic simulation of a first aid scenario is provided to the user and the second section is an interactive environment in which users apply the information they learn in the Simulation Courses module and finally, the learning levels of the players are measured in a simulation environment in the Examinations section.

                <p>
                  There are several researches on road accidents and traffic analysis, most of them have used simple survey analysis approaches. The authors of “Traffic Accident Analysis and Development of Accident Prediction Model” have done an investigation on models formulated by various Machine Learning algorithms, for classifying the severity of
injuries caused due to road traffic accidents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since police officers are tired due to excessive working hours, and shift work with sleepless nights because of ineffective work schedules, the study conducted by authors of “Police Work Scheduling: Management Issues and Practices” examines the relationship between management objectives, field operations, and officers' individual goals to provide effective management of police officers’ work schedules. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though the game-based learning is a well-recognized approach, the research work in using game-based learning to improve road safety awareness is very limited. The work on “Interactive Solution to Improve Flood Awareness Among Public – Flood Run” has developed a mobile game to improve public awareness on flood and their results show a significant improvement in players’ awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development of game-based learning applications for first aid awareness aims to instruct on handling a situation and act on it when encountered with a minor accident. The work of “FASim 3D serious game” has been carried out in Algeria to teach first-aid as a 3D serious game: “FASim”, and it is based on the agent-based simulation.
